<h2>Plot Breakdown: A Race Against Time</h2>

<p>The story of ‚ÄúArmor‚Äù kicks off with James Brody, a security guard working for an armored truck company.  He‚Äôs tasked with transporting millions of dollars between banks ‚Äì a job that seems pretty straightforward until Rook and his crew decide to pull off a massive heist. Rook, the mastermind behind the operation, doesn't just want money; he wants control.</p>

<p>The film quickly escalates into a thrilling car chase as Rook‚Äôs team attempts to steal the armored truck.  This isn‚Äôt a slow-burn thriller; it‚Äôs fast-paced and action-packed from the beginning. The chase leads them to a decrepit bridge, a location that becomes the key to their entrapment and James and his son Casey's desperate fight for survival.</p>

<p>The core conflict revolves around James protecting his son, Casey, throughout the ordeal.  Casey, portrayed by Josh Wiggins, adds another layer of emotional complexity to the story ‚Äì a young man caught in the middle of a violent situation, forced to rely on his father's experience and courage. The tension builds as Rook‚Äôs team surrounds the truck, creating a truly claustrophobic and dangerous environment.</p>

<h2>Cast Analysis: Performances That Shine</h2>

<p>The cast of ‚ÄúArmor‚Äù brings a significant amount of talent to the screen, delivering memorable performances that elevate the film beyond a typical action movie. Let's look at some key players:</p>
