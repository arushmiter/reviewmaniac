This blog post will take you on a deep dive into everything about ‚ÄúUntil Dawn,‚Äù from its captivating plot and talented cast to behind-the-scenes details and critical reviews.

<h2>Plot Summary: A Night of Terror</h2>

<p>The story begins with Clover Paul, who is grieving the disappearance of her sister, Melanie.
