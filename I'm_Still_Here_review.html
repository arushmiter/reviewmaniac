  <p>Selton Mello‚Äôs portrayal of Rubens is equally impressive.

The supporting cast, including Maria Manoella, adds depth to the film's emotional landscape.</p>

  <h2>Direction and Cinematography: A Visual Masterpiece</h2>

  <p>Walter Salles‚Äô direction is masterful, creating a sense of atmosphere and tension that permeates every scene. He skillfully uses visual cues ‚Äì the vastness of the beach, the muted colors, the close-ups on the characters' faces ‚Äì to convey the characters‚Äô emotional states.</p>

  <p>The cinematography by [Insert Cinematographer Name if available - otherwise state "the film's cinematographer"] is breathtaking. The use of natural light and the focus on capturing the beauty and harshness of Rio de Janeiro adds a layer of realism to the story. The beach scenes, in particular, are visually stunning, serving as both a refuge and a reminder of the characters‚Äô lost innocence.</p>

  <h2>Historical Context: Brazil's Military Dictatorship</h2>

  <p>"I‚Äôm Still Here" is deeply rooted in the historical context of Brazil's military dictatorship (1964-1985). The film doesn‚Äôt explicitly portray the political machinations of the regime, but it powerfully illustrates its impact on ordinary people like the Paivas. The arbitrary nature of the violence and the lack of justice are central themes throughout the story.</p>

  <p>The setting in 1971 provides a crucial backdrop for understanding the characters‚Äô struggles. During this period, Brazil was under military rule, characterized by political repression, human rights abuses, and widespread censorship. This context adds another layer of complexity to the film's themes of trauma, resilience, and the search for truth.</p>

  <h2>Themes and Symbolism: Loss, Resilience, and Identity</h2>

  <p>Several key themes run throughout ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Still Here.‚Äù The most prominent is grief ‚Äì the devastating impact of loss on individuals and families. The film explores how people cope with trauma in different ways, highlighting both the destructive and restorative aspects of grief.</p>

  <p>Resilience is another central theme. Despite facing unimaginable hardship, Eunice refuses to succumb to despair. She fights to rebuild her life and protect her daughter, demonstrating remarkable strength and determination. The film suggests that even in the darkest of times, it‚Äôs possible to find hope and create a new future.</p>

  <p>The beach itself is a powerful symbol in the film. It represents both loss ‚Äì the characters' exile from their former life ‚Äì and potential ‚Äì a space for rebuilding and finding solace. The constant presence of the ocean mirrors the ebb and flow of emotions experienced by the characters.</p>
