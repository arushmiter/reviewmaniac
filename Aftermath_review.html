<h2>Plot Analysis: A High-Stakes Game of Cat and Mouse</h2>

<p>‚ÄúAftermath‚Äù unfolds with relentless urgency.

<p>The revolutionaries, led by figures like ‚ÄòWisdom‚Äô (Mark Pettograsso) and ‚ÄòYankee‚Äô (Jason Armani Martinez), are portrayed as a group driven by a twisted sense of justice ‚Äì believing they're fighting against corruption and oppression. Their motivations remain somewhat ambiguous throughout the film, adding to the suspense. The core conflict arises when these revolutionaries seize control of the Tobin Memorial Bridge, taking hostages including Eric and his sister.</p>
