<p>Stranded with no communication and injured, the group quickly realizes they aren‚Äôt alone.

As supplies dwindle and panic sets in, the friends must confront their fears and work together to escape the swamp's deadly embrace.</p>

<p>The plot cleverly utilizes the classic survival horror trope of being isolated and vulnerable.
