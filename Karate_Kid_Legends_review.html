He quickly finds himself caught up with Victor Lipani (Joshua Jackson) and Mia Lipani (Sadie Stanley), who need his help ‚Äì leading him down a path that introduces him to the world of karate.</p>

<p>When Li discovers a need to defend himself and others, he seeks guidance from Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a legendary martial arts master who is also a descendant of the original Daniel LaRusso.  But it‚Äôs not just Mr. Han; Daniel LaRusso himself (Ralph Macchio) returns as a mentor, recognizing the potential in Li's skills and eager to pass on his knowledge.
