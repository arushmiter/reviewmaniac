  <h2>Movie Overview: A Descent into Darkness</h2>

  <h3>Plot Summary</h3>

  <p>‘The Containment’, officially titled “Poseída” in its original Spanish language version, tells the story of Caroline (played by Gia Hunter), who suddenly finds herself battling a malevolent entity within her own body. This isn’t just a simple possession; it’s a relentless struggle against an unknown power that seems to thrive on fear and doubt.  Caroline's mother, Michael (Jack Gouldbourne), desperately tries to help, but traditional medicine offers no solution. Neither does any expert in exorcisms.</p>

  <p>As the situation spirals out of control, they seek assistance from Sister Esperanza (Fernanda Romero), a nun who initially appears to be an expert in dealing with demonic forces. However, her methods and beliefs lead to a shocking revelation: the demon isn't just trying to possess Caroline; it’s sowing seeds of doubt about everything – even the truth about Sister Esperanza herself! This twist elevates the horror beyond a simple possession story into a complex mystery filled with suspense.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, ‘The Containment’ is a race against time as Caroline fights to regain control and uncover the true nature of the evil that threatens to consume her. The film masterfully builds tension through unsettling visuals and a genuinely frightening performance by Gia Hunter.</p>
