<h2>Plot Summary: A Dream on an Island</h2>

<p>The story begins with Charles Heath (Tim Key), a somewhat lonely man who lives on Wallis Island. He has one big goal: to hire Herb McGwyer (Tom Basden), a famous folk musician, to play a private concert for him. Herb is a talented but slightly faded star, and Charles truly believes this gig will be the highlight of his life.</p>

<p>However, there‚Äôs a twist! Herb also has other commitments. His ex-bandmate, Nell Mortimer (Carey Mulligan), and her husband, Michael, are coming to the island too.  Nell and Herb had a complicated past, and Charles isn't aware of this connection. As the story unfolds, old tensions bubble up, and the stormy weather on Wallis Island traps everyone together, leading to hilarious misunderstandings and dramatic confrontations.</p>

<p>The film cleverly weaves together three storylines: Charles‚Äôs desperate attempts to secure Herb, Nell and Michael‚Äôs return, and the simmering romantic history between Herb and Nell. It's a classic ‚Äòreunion‚Äô story with plenty of humor and heart. The storm adds an extra layer of suspense as it threatens to derail Charles‚Äôs dream and expose secrets from the past.</p>
