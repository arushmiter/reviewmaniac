<h2>Plot Analysis: A Descent into Chaos</h2>

The plane becomes a microcosm of global conflict, with mercenaries, government agents, and shadowy organizations all converging on the same location.</p>

<p>What makes the plot particularly effective is its reliance on classic ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù tropes ‚Äì the claustrophobic setting of an airplane, the limited resources, the overwhelming number of enemies.
