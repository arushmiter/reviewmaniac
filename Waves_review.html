This conflict escalates when his younger brother, Pavel (Ondrej Stupka), gets mixed up in a dangerous situation. The story unfolds as a series of events triggered by a seemingly small misunderstanding, quickly turning into a full-blown crisis that tests the bonds between the brothers and everyone around them.
