<p>Then, a devastatingly bad day occurs ‚Äì a series of unfortunate events pile up, creating an immense amount of stress and frustration. This is where the "straw" comes in; it represents that one small thing, when combined with all the other pressures, pushes Janiyah to her absolute limit.  The movie doesn‚Äôt shy away from showing the raw emotion and the desperate need for a solution.</p>

<p>As things escalate, Janiyah makes a shocking decision ‚Äì an act of desperation meant to protect her son.
