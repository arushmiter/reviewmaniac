He‚Äôs driven by a strange, almost obsessive desire.  What he doesn't know is that the painting is actually the work of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsg√•rd), an ancient and malevolent vampire.  Orlok isn't interested in wealth or power; he's consumed by a primal hunger for human blood, and Hutter becomes his unwitting prey.</p>

    <p>As Hutter brings Orlok back to his home, the Count‚Äôs influence begins to corrupt him and those around him.  The film slowly unravels into a terrifying tale of obsession, decay, and the horrifying consequences of succumbing to darkness.
