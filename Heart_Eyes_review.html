  <p>Let’s be honest, finding something exciting to do on Valentine's Day can sometimes feel like a real challenge. You might be stuck at home with only your favorite movie or maybe you are looking for a fun date night idea. But what if I told you there was a new horror comedy that promised a thrilling and funny adventure?  “Heart Eyes” delivers just that, offering a unique take on the serial killer genre while embracing the chaos of a holiday known for romance – and sometimes, a little bit of terror.</p>

  <h2>About Heart Eyes: The Story</h2>

  <p>The movie is set in Seattle, Washington, on Valentine’s Day. Two co-workers, Ally McCabe (played by Olivia Holt) and Jay Simmonds (Mason Gooding), are working overtime at a commercial shoot.

The killer mistakes Ally and Jay for a real couple, leading to a wild and dangerous chase across the city.</p>

  <p>The story is based on the idea of mistaken identity – it’s really funny when things go wrong!
