<h2>About "I'm Still Here" - A Story Rooted in Truth</h2>

<p>Released in 2024, “I’m Still Here” (originally titled *Ainda Estou Aqui*) is a masterful piece of filmmaking. Directed by Walter Salles, known for his work on ‘Central Station’ and ‘Motorway’, this film isn't just entertainment; it’s a historical drama based on a novel. The story centers around Eunice Paiva, played brilliantly by Fernanda Torres, who finds her life irrevocably altered after a shocking incident during Brazil’s repressive military regime.</p>

<p>The movie takes place in the 1970s, primarily in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. It's a period of immense political turmoil, marked by the dictatorship led by General Ernesto Geisel. This backdrop significantly shapes Eunice’s journey as she struggles to protect her family and rebuild their lives after an arbitrary act of violence shatters everything they knew.</p>

<h2>The Plot Unfolds: A Family Torn Apart</h2>

<p>Eunice Paiva, played with incredible nuance by Fernanda Torres, is married to Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a former Labour Party congressman. They live a seemingly ordinary life with their children, Veroca and Eliana, until a fateful night when a violent event – often referred to as "Baby Bocayuva" – disrupts their world. This event, a brutal act of political repression, forces Eunice to completely reinvent herself and her family's future.</p>

<p>The film doesn’t offer easy answers or tidy resolutions. Instead, it portrays the raw emotions of grief, fear, and determination that consume the Paiva family. It shows how they cope with loss, navigate a corrupt system, and ultimately, fight to reclaim their lives.</p>
