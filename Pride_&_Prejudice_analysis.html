This is a really important problem for the family because if Mr. Bennet dies without leaving them money, they‚Äôll lose their home.</p>

<p>Enter Mr. Bingley, a wealthy and friendly man who moves into the neighborhood. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy with him.  Mr. Darcy is very proud and seems to look down on everyone else.
