<h2>Plot Breakdown: Salvage Gone Wrong</h2>

<p>The film‚Äôs plot kicks off with a ragtag team of divers led by Clara Bennett (Hermione Corfield) embarking on a mission to recover a 1970s Ford Mustang from the bottom of a river. This isn't just some casual dive; it's a risky operation, requiring specialized equipment and a healthy dose of bravery. The team consists of Dylan 'Bull' Maddock (Jake Ryan), Janusz Wojcik (Josh McConville), Dwight Lewis (Kevin Dee), Bob Drummond (Clayton Watson), Frank Sturgess (Sam Parsonson), Jimmy Barriakada (Jacob Junior Nayinggul), Ernie Morgan (Arthur Angel), Shaun Cullen (Maximillian Johnson) and Sgt Potter (Will Fletcher).  They‚Äôre motivated by a combination of money and the thrill of the challenge, but little do they know they've stumbled into something far more dangerous.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after beginning the salvage operation, they encounter a single bull shark ‚Äì an animal known for its aggression. This isn't just a casual swim; the shark displays an unusually high level of hostility, attacking the divers with brutal force.  What starts as a tense recovery mission quickly descends into a chaotic battle for survival against this apex predator. The film expertly builds suspense, using tight camera angles and unsettling underwater sound design to create a truly terrifying experience.</p>
