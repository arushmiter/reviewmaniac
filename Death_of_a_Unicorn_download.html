This movie tells the story of a father and daughter who accidentally kill a magical unicorn, leading to a wild and unpredictable adventure filled with rich people, bizarre secrets, and surprisingly dark humor.  It’s a unique blend of genres that aims for something truly special, but does it deliver? Let's find out!</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a movie that just…doesn’t quite click? You start excited about the idea, maybe because of the actors or the genre, but then the story doesn’t make sense, the characters don’t seem real, and you end up feeling frustrated.  “Death of a Unicorn” seems to be grappling with this problem – it has interesting concepts and talented actors, but its execution feels somewhat uneven. This article will break down everything about this film, from its bizarre plot and surprising cast choices to its production details and what critics are saying.</p>

<h2>About “Death of a Unicorn”: A Quick Overview</h2>

<p>“Death of a Unicorn” was released in March 2025 and has a runtime of approximately 1 hour and 47 minutes (107 minutes). It’s classified as a horror, fantasy, and comedy. The film garnered a rating of 6.436/10 based on 287 votes, which suggests it's not a massive blockbuster but has a dedicated fanbase. Its popularity score of 41.3872 indicates moderate interest.</p>

<p>The movie was produced by A24, Square Peg, Secret Engine, and Ley Line Entertainment. Alex Scharfman directed the film, writing it himself. The budget was set at $15 million, and it has already earned $15.983 million at the box office – a decent return for a smaller indie project.</p>

<h2>The Plot: Accidentally Killing a Unicorn</h2>

<p>The story begins with Ridley (Jenna Ortega) and her father, Elliot (Paul Rudd), on their way to a weekend retreat hosted by Shepard (Will Poulter), a wealthy businessman obsessed with the healing properties of unicorns. These unicorns aren’t just ordinary horses; they possess magical abilities that can cure illnesses – a very valuable thing in the right hands.</p>

<p>During their journey, Ridley and Elliot accidentally run over a unicorn. This isn't just any accident; the unicorn is revealed to be incredibly special, protected by a group of eccentric individuals led by Odell (Richard E. Grant). This event kicks off a series of increasingly chaotic events as Shepard wants to exploit the unicorn’s power for profit, leading to a confrontation filled with dark humor and unexpected twists.</p>

<p>The film cleverly uses the idea of a ‘dark fantasy’ – taking fantastical elements like unicorns and combining them with unsettling comedy and horror. The plot thickens when it’s revealed that Shepard isn't simply greedy; he has a deeply disturbed obsession with the unicorn, bordering on psychosis.  This adds another layer to the already complicated situation.</p>

<h2>Cast Performances: A Star-Studded Ensemble</h2>

<p>The cast of “Death of a Unicorn” is surprisingly strong, featuring several well-known actors in supporting roles. Jenna Ortega delivers a compelling performance as Ridley, portraying her character's vulnerability and growing determination to protect the unicorn. Her ability to balance the horror elements with comedic timing is impressive.</p>

<p>Paul Rudd shines as Elliot, providing much of the film’s humor. He plays the role of a somewhat hapless but ultimately caring father, struggling to understand his daughter’s increasingly serious decisions.  His chemistry with Ortega is believable and adds depth to their relationship.</p>

<p>Will Poulter as Shepard is truly unsettling. He perfectly embodies the character's delusional obsession, creating a genuinely frightening villain. Richard E. Grant provides excellent support as Odell, the protector of the unicorn, adding a touch of eccentric charm to the narrative.  The supporting cast, including Téa Leoni, Sunita Mani, and Steve Park, all contribute effectively to the film’s overall atmosphere.</p>
